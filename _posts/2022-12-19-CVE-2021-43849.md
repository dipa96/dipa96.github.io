`cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio` is a plugin provides a single and simple interface for accessing fingerprint APIs.  
**In versions prior to 5.0.1** the exported activity `de.niklasmerz.cordova.biometric.BiometricActivity` can cause the app to crash. This vulnerability occurred because the activity didn't handle the case where it is requested with invalid or empty data which results in a crash.

 *Any third party app can constantly call this activity with no permission. A 3rd party app/attacker using event listener can continually stop the app from working and make the victim unable to open it.*

## PoC (Proof of Concept)

```sh
adb shell am start -n de.niklasmerz.cordova.biometric/.BiometricActivity -e "" ""
```

**Expected result**: App will crash

## In Depth

The `android:exported` attribute sets whether other apps can launch one of your app's components (activity, service, content provider, or broadcast receiver): If `true` , any app can access the app component. If you set an activity's `android:exported` attribute to `true` , another app can launch it by its exact class name. In this case we can send data from outside to the `BiometricActivity`. Sending **empty data** will cause the application to crash and exploit **Denial of Service(DoS)** vulnerabilities.

### Vulnerable Code

In `AndroidManifest.xml` config file, `android:exported` is set to `true` as follow:

```xml
<activity android:name="de.niklasmerz.cordova.biometric.BiometricActivity" android:theme="@style/TransparentTheme" android:exported="true"/>
```

*The Android Manifest is an XML file containing metadata that describes
your applications information, functionality and requirements to
the Android OS, and the PlayStore.*

## Remediation

Version 5.0.1 of the cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio doesn't export the activity anymore and is no longer vulnerable.

### Sanitized code

If you want to fix older versions change the attribute `android:exported` of this code snippet in `plugin.xml` to false as below.

```xml
<config-file target="AndroidManifest.xml" parent="application">
      <activity android:name="de.niklasmerz.cordova.biometric.BiometricActivity" android:theme="@style/TransparentTheme" android:exported="false"/>
</config-file>
```
