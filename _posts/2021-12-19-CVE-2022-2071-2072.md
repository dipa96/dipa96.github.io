CVE-2022-2071 and CVE-2022-2072 Analysis & PoC

## Name Directory < 1.25.3 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting

The plugin does not sanitise and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting. Furthermore, as the payload is also saved into the database after the request, it leads to a Stored XSS as well

## Name Directory < 1.25.4 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting via CSRF

The plugin does not have CSRF check when importing names, and is also lacking sanitisation as well as escaping in some of the imported data, which could allow attackers to make a logged in admin import arbitrary names with XSS payloads in them.
